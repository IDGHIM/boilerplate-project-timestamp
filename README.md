## 📌 Project Requirements

- [x] You should provide your own project, not the example URL.
- [x] A request to `/api/:date?` with a valid date should return a JSON object with a `unix` key that is a Unix timestamp of the input date in milliseconds (as type Number)
- [x] A request to `/api/:date?` with a valid date should return a JSON object with a `utc` key that is a string of the input date in the format: `Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 GMT`
- [x] A request to `/api/1451001600000` should return `{ unix: 1451001600000, utc: "Fri, 25 Dec 2015 00:00:00 GMT" }`
- [x] Your project can handle dates that can be successfully parsed by `new Date(date_string)`
- [x] If the input date string is invalid, the API returns an object having the structure `{ error : "Invalid Date" }`
- [x] An empty date parameter should return the current time in a JSON object with a `unix` key
- [x] An empty date parameter should return the current time in a JSON object with a `utc` key
